# AdminRDP
AdminRDP is a tabbed RDP application with the ability to store different credentials, server lists, and groups. This was a side project I started to help with the growing number of domains and usernames I was acquiring. No RDP application gave me exactly what I wanted so I designed my own. 

CREDENTIALS
AdminRDP allows you to store an unlimited number of credentials that are NOT tied to any particular server profile. Passwords are stored, and encrypted and can only be recovered by the current user who saved the passwords. This makes seamless switching betwen domains and usernames a breeze.

SERVER LISTS AND GROUPS
Allows you to save servers and lists of servers so you do not have to keep typing in the same name over and over again. There is also an import from a list option if you have a particular list of servers you would like to transfer. 

CURRENT RELEASE
The current release is under the RELEASE folder. Run the BAT file to install and it will take care of the rest. 

REQUIREMENTS
Powershell 3.0 or greater
